# Archived Repository

This repository is part of the historical Geomore / Maptime Bmore project space.  
It is no longer actively maintained and has been archived to preserve the story of the community.

## About This Archive
From 2013 to 2023, Geomore and Maptime Bmore hosted meetups, workshops, and open-geo events throughout Baltimore.  
Leadership and hosting eventually transitioned over the years, and the community wrapped up naturally as people moved on.

The full project timeline and background are available here:  
**https://github.com/Geomore/geomore.github.io**

## Current Status
This repository is read-only.  
Issues, pull requests, and new commits have been disabled to keep the historical record intact.

## Thank You
Thanks to everyone who participated, contributed, presented, or simply showed up.  
These archives are a snapshot of a fun and meaningful chapter in Baltimore’s geo community.
